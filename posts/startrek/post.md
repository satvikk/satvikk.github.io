## Data 
- IMDb Ratings and Episode information from https://datasets.imdbws.com (collected on Nov 23, 2021). This formed the source for the tabular data used in the analysis
- Script Data from www.chakoteya.net/StarTrek/. This was the source for the script of each episode in text form. This was used to calculate a proxy for each character's relative screentime in each episode. This proxy variable was then merged with the tabular data 
- Four TV Shows: 
  - Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987–1994)
  - Star Trek: Deep Space 9 (1993–1999)
  - Star Trek: Voyager (1995–2001)
  - Star Trek: Enterprise (2001–2005)
- 614 Episodes in all
- Relevant Variables: 
  - Name of Director(s)
  - Name of writer(s)
  - Episode Rating
  - Proxy Character Screentimes for main characters (33 in all)

## Research Questions 🔬
- Which characters have the greatest influence on the ratings of episodes, either positive or negative?
- Are their differences in quality across the four shows and their constituent seasons?
- Are their differences in quality across the directors?

## Methodology 🛠️
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Statistical Modeling
  - Heirarchical Linear Regression
  - Fixed Effects: Character Screentimes
  - Random Effects: Show:Season combination, Name of director(s)
- Tools Used: R 4.1.1

## Results 📊
> 🔑 Influence of Characters  

![plot](./screentime_coef.png?raw=true)
- The figure illustrates the estimated average change in episode rating when a character's screentime is increased by 1 percentage point. This increase is at the expense of the screentime of "other" characters i.e. any character not included in the main character list. Corresponding 95% confidence intervals are also illustrated
- Most characters were not observed to have a significant impact on episode ratings
- Screentime of Sisko from Star Trek: Deep Space 9 and Paris from Star Trek: Voyager have the strongest positive impact on episode ratings
- Screentime of Dr. Crusher, Troi, and Wesley from Star Trek: The Next Generation, and Dax from Star Trek: Deep Space 9 have the strongest negative impact on the ratings

> 🔑 Differences across Shows and Seasons  

![Alt text](./show_season_dotplot.png?raw=true)
- Significant difference in quality across Show:Seasons was observed. Season 1 of The Next Generations was the worst while Season 6 of The Next Generations was the best
 
> 🔑 Quality of Directors  

There was no evidence for difference in quality across directors. This is likely due to the small number of episodes per director.
